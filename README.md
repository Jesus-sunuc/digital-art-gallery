# Digital Art Gallery 
I want to create an online art gallery that lets people see and learn about art. This website would have pictures of artworks, information about them, and stories about the artists. I think this is important because it lets more people enjoy and understand art.

In this gallery, people could look at art, learn about different art styles and history, and even make their own collections of their favorite pieces. They could also share what they like with friends and talk to others who like art. The website would be easy to use, letting people search for art they like and discover new things in a fun way.

I want to build this because I love both technology and I have some friends that love art and want to put their work on internet, so I think it is a great opportunity for me to do something like this, learn and help my friends with this tool that they can use it in the future. Making this gallery would let me use my skills to share art with others in a new way. It's exciting to think about using the internet to help people learn about and enjoy art from anywhere in the world.
